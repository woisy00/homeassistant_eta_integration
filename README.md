# ETA integration for home assistant
Integration of ETA (Heating) sensors to home assistant

Uses the ETA REST API to get sensor values.
Inspiration for getting sensor data came from: https://github.com/hubtub2/ha_custom_components


Note: You have to activate the API on your pellet heater first: see documentation http://www.holzheizer-forum.de/attachment/28434-eta-restful-v1-1-pdf/

## Installation:
Configuration for the Eta integration is performed via a config flow as opposed to yaml configuration file.
